Setup Shell
=========

This role will setup your shell if your using a *nix like system.

Requirements
------------

Python, Pip, and Ansible-Core will need to be installed on the laptop for this to work.

If zsh shell isn't working properly, then you might need to reboot the system. If the changes don't work AFTER a proper full reboot then open an issue and I'll investigate the issue.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: localhost
      roles:
         - role: setup-shell
