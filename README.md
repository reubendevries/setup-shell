=========

This role will setup your shell if your using a *nix like system.

Python, Pip, and Ansible-Core will need to be installed on the laptop for this to work.

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

      roles:
         - role: setup-shell
